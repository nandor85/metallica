On April 26, 2019 – just before we take off for our annual European summer vacation – we'll celebrate one of our favorite hometown traditions, Metallica Night at Oracle Park with the San Francisco Giants.<br> Members of the band will be on hand to start things off with the National Anthem and first pitch, sticking around all night to cheer on the team against the New York Yankees.<br> As is customary, we'll take part in some of the between-inning fun and games, as well as an exclusive pre-game VIP event (more on that below).<br>
				Special Event Metallica ticket packages include a ticket to the game and a limited-edition Metallica/Giants reversible knit beanie. A portion of the proceeds from every Metallica Night Special Event ticket sold will benefit All Within My Hands.<br>
				There will also be a pre-game VIP event in Triples Alley as we celebrate the release of our very own Blackened American Whiskey and, in partnership with Stone Brewing Co.’s Arrogant Consortia, Enter Night Pilsner.<br> Lars, Robert, and key players from both companies will be on hand for a Q & A.<br> And of course the Blackened and Enter Night will be flowing out in Triples! Once again, All Within My Hands will benefit from ticket sales to this exclusive event.<br>
				Fifth Members will have a chance to purchase tickets in a special presale on Friday, February 8th at 12 PM PST; log in to your Fifth Member account and visit the Club News section at that time for a link to purchase tickets to the game and the VIP event early.

Thanks to nugs.net, we’ve been able to offer a variety of formats from mp3 to high-res audio and – over the past few years – a CD option as well for the fans of physical media out there.

Sign up here or download the app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play Store to start your 30-day free trial and take your music with you wherever you go.<br>
		Finally, don't forget that all tickets sold on the '18-'19 North American tour also include a free MP3 download … all you need to do is scan the barcode on your ticket or enter it in on LiveMetallica.com/scan to pick up that free download of the full set.<br>We're psyched to be back out on the road, so we'll see YOU out there!</p>

			<p class="w3-padding w3-justify news">It’s certainly been no secret, but we are beyond excited to make the official announcement and introduction to Enter Night Pilsner, our collaboration with Arrogant Consortia, a Stone Brewing imprint. If you’ve been to one of our recent arena shows, you may have sipped from the black and red cans or even picked up a few in the surrounding neighborhoods. Now we’re expanding nationwide, and come spring, taking it international covering Europe, Australia, China and beyond!<br>
			Stone Brewing is the perfect partner for us with endless commonalities in our ideals, outlooks, and paths forward. Our views of the worlds that we each inhabit, of creativity and process, and of sense of place in relation to our peers and “The Man” are almost identical. This collaboration is beyond effortless and pure, and we can’t wait to share this incredible beverage with everyone out there. In conjunction with the leadership of Stone, we have participated throughout every step alongside their talented brewing team. From our HQ outside of San Francisco to Stone’s brewery and HQ in San Diego to many beers backstage at shows, the spirit of collaboration was powerful.<br>
			Keep watching for Enter Night Pilsner at our shows as we fire up the tour again later this week and check out the Arrogant Consortia beer finder to locate Enter Night near you.<br>
			Don’t see it in your neighborhood yet? Check back…our friends at Stone are putting those Enter Night cans and kegs in new locations all the time!

			<p class="w3-padding w3-justify news">We’re incredibly excited and very proud to announce that All Within My Hands has launched a major workforce education initiative that will provide direct support to community colleges programs providing skills and services to students who are looking to enter a traditional trade or other applied learning program. Ten colleges from across the country have been selected to receive $100,000 to support more than 1,000 students training to enter the American workforce. These students will become the first group of Metallica Scholars.<br>
			AWMH has partnered with the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), a Washington, D.C.-based organization that represents the nation’s 1,103 community colleges. The awards are designed to provide support of relevant job skill training for community college students and reinvest in communities that supported us during our recent U.S. tours.<br>
			We are so fortunate that music has provided us the opportunity to be successful doing something we are passionate about. We want to share our success with others so that they can find a job where they can do the same. Thanks to your continued support we’re able to launch this new program and remain focused on the fight against hunger around the world. Click here for more info and a list of the colleges receiving grants.</p>
